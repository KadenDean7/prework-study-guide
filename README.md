# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

I built this project because I am interested in learning how to become a full stack developer and this was a great entry project into learning the basics of what might go on in the environment.

## Installation

## Usage

This study guide will hopefully be filled with notes by the end of the course. I do want to consistently update each section with relevant notes as they come by so I have a collection to look back on when needed. If you open the console you can see that there is JavaScript running that will list each topic and chose one to focus studying on.
